# maze-search-csharp

## Python
``` ./python $ python search.py ```

## C#
``` ./MazeSearch $ dotnet run ```
NOTE: This does not work on Windows (use Windows Subsystem for Linux if you're using Windows)

NOTE: Could probably make it run faster if we build a string for each row of the maze and then call addString() instead of addString() per character
NOTE: Could add docker file to run in linux container
